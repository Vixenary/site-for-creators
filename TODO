TODO:
- Create hamburger menu for when the width is < 900px
- Set up format and styling for actual generated Markdown pages
- Think about converting top navbar to fixed position instead of relative
- Implement sitemap generation:
  - Put all navigation into one .yaml file
  - Generate top nav into its own template (that will later be included in the
    main landing/content page templates with `$top-nav()$`)
  - Generate the sitemap into its own template (that will later be included in
    main content page template with `$sitemap()$`)
  - Create a LUA filter that will run over the HTML-generated content pages and
    remove non-relevant sitemap content
    - The filter will read the name of the *generated* file to open from the
      `filepath` metadata provided when running the pandoc command from the batch script
      - For example, if we're converting `content.md` to `content.html`,
        `filepath` should reference `content.html` since that's the file we need to edit
    - Note: When looping through the landing/content source files to convert,
      the filepath should be provided through `--metadata filepath="..."` so
      users don't need to provide it in the file
      - Can probably get the filepath as a variable and use it in the actual
        pandoc command as well
  - When generating each content page, specify the `--lua-filter` so that
    irrelevant sitemap content is removed
