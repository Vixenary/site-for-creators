        This site is just a personal project I felt like working on during
        quarantine. I'll host some random guides, thoughts about things going
        on, etc. that I feel like writing up (hence the site title). For
        example, I wrote a really old guide about a program called Macroquest2
        a long time ago that I might port to this site.

        I've also thought about putting together some basic technical writing
        pages that list some different resources that could be used to start
        learning what technical writing is like. Technical writing is what I do
        for a living, so I thought it might be interesting to collect some of
        my thoughts here.

        If you're interested in art, I've also thought about posting
        commissions, pictures of art I have up on my walls, and such. You can
        probably find most of that on my Twitter (if I've even remembered to
        post it), but it might be here as well.

        I have links to my Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn in the top right
        corner of the site in case any of this seems interesting and you feel
        like looking for more. I'll probably end up posting the source for
        this on my GitHub if I feel that someone might be able to get some
        worth out of it.
